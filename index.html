					<h2>Why is Scrum needed?</h2>
					<p>Scrum is designed for the rapid development and delivery of complex, fundamentally new products that are not on the market.</p>
				</section>
				<!-- <section>
					<section>
						<h2>Scrum Theory</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>Scrum is founded on empiricism and lean thinking.</li>
							<li>Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and to control risk.</li>
							<li>Empirical Scrum pillars: transparency, inspection, and adaptation.</li>
						</ol>
					</section> -->
					<!-- <section>
						<h3>transparency</h3>
						The emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work.
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>inspection</h3>
							The Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently to detect potentially undesirable variances or problems.
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>adaptation</h3>
							If any aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits or if the resulting product is unacceptable, the process being applied or the materials being produced must be adjusted.
					</section>
				</section> -->

						<h2>Scrum basics</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>1. Work is carried out in iterations, which in Scrum are called Sprints</h3>
						<p>Sprint consists of:</p>
						<div style="text-align: start">1. Sprint Planning</div>
						<div style="text-align: start">2. Daily Scrum</div>
						<div style="text-align: start">3. Sprint Review</div>
						<div style="text-align: start">4. Sprint Retrospective</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>2. The result of the work can be considered only what is ready for use</h3>
						<div style="text-align: start; margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 38px;">The result of the Sprint is called an Increment, a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal.</div>
						<div style="text-align: start; margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 38px;">Work cannot be considered part of an Increment unless it meets the Definition of Done.</div>
						<div style="text-align: start; margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 38px;">The Definition of Done is a formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product.</div>
						<div style="text-align: start; font-size: 38px;">The moment a Product Backlog item meets the Definition of Done, an Increment is born.</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>3. The product is developed by a self-managed team</h3>
						<div style="text-align: start; font-size: 38px;">Self-management in Scrum implies independence not only in the choice of who and how will do the work (self-organization), 
							but also in the choice of what exactly to work on in order to achieve the goal of the product.</div>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Scrum Team</h2>
						<p>The Scrum Team consists of one <b>Scrum Master</b>, one <b>Product Owner</b>, and <b>Developers</b>.</p>	
							Typically 10 or fewer people.
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Developers</h3>
						The features of the Scrum team that are specifically related to the Developers:
							<div style="text-align: start">1. "Cross-functionality"</div>
							<div style="text-align: start">2. Dedicated 100% to work on the product</div>
							<div style="text-align: start">3. The composition of the team does not change</div>
							<div style="text-align: start">4. Scrum does not recognize role differences between developers</div>
							<div style="text-align: start">5. Collaborative work</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Product Owner</h3>
						The Product Owner is responsible for creating a really cool and valuable product for customers.
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Scrum Master</h3>
							The Scrum Master is not a boss, he does not limit or punish. His role is to help the team figure out what obstacles prevent it from working at maximum efficiency.
							And teach it to remove these obstacles, whether it be process dysfunctions within the team, poor team communication with specific external people / departments, 
							or any outdated regulations that apply throughout the organization.

						<h2>Scrum Events</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Sprint</h3>
						<p>Sprints are the heartbeat of Scrum, where ideas are turned into value.</p>
						<p style="text-align: start">During the Sprint:</p>
						<div style="text-align: start">1. No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;</div>
						<div style="text-align: start">2. Quality does not decrease;</div>
						<div style="text-align: start">3. The Product Backlog is refined as needed;</div>
						<div style="text-align: start">4. Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned.</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Sprint Planning</h3>
						Sprint Planning addresses the following topics:
						<div style="text-align: start">Topic One: Why is this Sprint valuable?</div>
						<div style="text-align: start">Topic Two: What can be Done this Sprint?</div>
						<div style="text-align: start">Topic Three: How will the chosen work get done? </div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Daily scrum</h3>
							15-minute meeting at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint.
					</section>
					<section >
						<h3>Sprint Review</h3>
						<div style="text-align: start; margin-bottom: 15px;">The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations.</div>
						<div style="text-align: start">The Sprint Review is the second to last event of the Sprint and is timeboxed to a maximum of four hours for a one-month Sprint.</div>
					</section>
					<section >
						<h3>Sprint Retrospective</h3>
						<div style="text-align: start; margin-bottom: 15px;">The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.</div>
						<div style="text-align: start">The Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint. It is timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a one-month Sprint.</div>
					</section>
				</section>
				<!-- <section>
					<section>
						<h2>Scrum Artifacts</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<div style="text-align: start">Scrumâ€™s artifacts represent work or value.</div>
						<p style="text-align: start">
							Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured:
						</p>
						<ul style="margin: 0 0 0 -2em;">
							<li >For the Product Backlog it is the Product Goal.</li>
							<li>For the Sprint Backlog it is the Sprint Goal.</li>
							<li>For the Increment it is the Definition of Done.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Product Backlog</h3>
						<div style="text-align: start; margin-bottom: 15px;">
							The Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. 
							It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.
						</div>
						<div style="text-align: start; margin-bottom: 15px;">Commitment: <b style="color: gold;">Product Goal</b> </div>
						<div style="text-align: start">The Product Goal describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against.</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Sprint Backlog</h3>
						<div style="text-align: start; margin-bottom: 15px;">
							The Sprint Backlog is composed of the Sprint Goal (<span style="font-style: italic;">why</span>), 
							the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (<span style="font-style: italic;">what</span>),
							as well as an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (<span style="font-style: italic;">how</span>).
						</div>
						<div style="text-align: start; margin-bottom: 15px;">Commitment: <b style="color: gold;">Sprint  Goal</b> </div>
						<div style="text-align: start">The Sprint Goal is the single objective for the Sprint.
							The Sprint Goal is created during the Sprint Planning event and then added to the Sprint Backlog.</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Increment</h3>
						<div style="text-align: start; margin-bottom: 15px;">
							An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal.
							Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together.
						</div>
						<div style="text-align: start; margin-bottom: 15px;">Commitment: <b style="color: gold;">Definition of Done</b> </div>
						<div style="text-align: start; font-size: 38px;">
							The Definition of Done is a formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product.
							The moment a Product Backlog item meets the Definition of Done, an Increment is born.</div>
